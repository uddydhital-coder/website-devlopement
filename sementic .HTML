                <h2>Facts About Dog</h2>
                <p>Dogs are ancient companions, evolved from wolves, possessing incredible senses (smell 10,000x better than ours), unique nose prints, and the ability to see some colors, learn many words, detect diseases, and even ride subways like in Russia; they have three eyelids, sweat through paws, dream, and differ in traits like being right/left-pawed, with breeds like the Chihuahua being smallest and Dalmatians starting white.</p> <br>

            <aside>
                Smell: Their noses are incredibly sensitive, helping them detect diseases (cancer, diabetes) and smell emotions like fear through sweat. A dog's nose print is unique, like a human fingerprint.
